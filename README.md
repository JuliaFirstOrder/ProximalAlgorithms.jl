A Julia package for non-smooth optimization algorithms.

This package provides algorithms for the minimization of objective functions
that include non-smooth terms, such as constraints or non-differentiable penalties.
Implemented algorithms include:
* (Fast) Proximal gradient methods
* Douglas-Rachford splitting
* Three-term splitting
* Primal-dual splitting algorithms
* Newton-type methods

This package works well in combination with [ProximalOperators](https://github.com/JuliaFirstOrder/ProximalOperators.jl) (>= 0.15),
which contains a wide range of functions that can be used to express cost terms.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome in the form of [issues notification](https://github.com/JuliaFirstOrder/ProximalAlgorithms.jl/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/JuliaFirstOrder/ProximalAlgorithms.jl/pulls). We recommend looking at already implemented algorithms to get inspiration on how to structure new ones.
